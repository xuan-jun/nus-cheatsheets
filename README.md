# NUS Cheatsheets

This is a collection of cheatsheets or summary notes that I have made over my course of studies in NUS. The quality of the cheatsheets are probably not the best so use it at your own discretion. I have also listed down the relevant semesters that I have taken it in so you can have a look at how relevant the content will be. Quality of the cheatsheets also probably got better as the semesters progressed.

I would highly suggest that you make your own cheatsheets as it will help your learning much better.
